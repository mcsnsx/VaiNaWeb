                <h2>The Servant - James C. Hunter</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>This book is the kind of book that everyone should read at different times in their lives. 
                        The whole plot is of incredible depth and brings many reflections.
                        The work brings the story of an executive who goes to a monastery to meet a monk and has a class on leadership with him. </p>
                    <p>It's my favorite book because it made me think about things I usually ignore or never noticed, it made me rethink ideas 
                        and behaviors that made me grow as a person. I recommend without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
